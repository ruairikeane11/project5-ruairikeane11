### Colors 
- The website uses 3 main colours. The footer and the nav are both dark grey with green icons and buttons. 
The main body of each page is a lightgray to contrast with the darker shade in the nav and footer. I chose green as this colour represents sustainablity, which is a main priority at Green Couture.


### Font 
- I decided to use the 'Barlow Condensed' font from [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/) throughout all pages of the website, because it is plain while also being captivating for the viewer. 

### Icons 
- The icons are found in both the nav and footer, located at the bottom of every page. They are taken from [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/), and are all utilised as classes in the i tag, therefore easily targeted and customised. Once an icon clicked, the link will bring you to the desired website.

# Features
### Navbar
- The website incorpates a responsive navbar depending on the screen size in use. The navbar features a dropdown menu with links to the profile page, a search bar and also a link to your basket. When viewing the site on a mobile, a burger icon is on the top left hand corner, and the other buttons are placed on the right hand side.

- If the site user clicks on the search icon, and search bar will toggle beneath so the user can make search queries to find a desired item.
